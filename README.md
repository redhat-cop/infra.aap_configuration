<!-- Describe the collection and why a user would want to use it. What does the collection do? -->

This is a collection of roles for AWX/Tower.

## External requirements

This collection depends on the awx.collection since it uses the modules there.

### Supported connections
<!-- Optional. If your collection supports only specific connection types (such as HTTPAPI, netconf, or others), list them here. -->

## Included content

<!-- Galaxy will eventually list the module docs within the UI, but until that is ready, you may need to either describe your plugins etc here, or point to an external docsite to cover that information. -->

## Using this collection

<!--Include some quick examples that cover the most common use cases for your collection content. -->
