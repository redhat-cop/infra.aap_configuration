infra.aap\_configuration Release Notes
======================================

.. contents:: Topics

v3.4.1
======

Bugfixes
--------

- Reverts the aap_token being applied to hub roles. Instead hub_token is now used.

v3.4.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Defaulted the new variables 'hub_state', 'hub_path_prefix', 'hub_token' to the old ones for backward compatibility.
- Dependent collections added to galaxy.yml
- Moved some docs to the docs folder
- Removed all references to awx.awx because we no longer support that officially
- Renamed 'ah_state', 'ah_path_prefix', 'ah_token' variables to 'hub_state', 'hub_path_prefix', 'hub_token' in hub roles.
- Updated links to use FQDN vs short links so they will work outside of github

Bugfixes
--------

- The 'auto_migrate_users_to' field can't be 'false' as default. Omit instead.
- changes the 2 places that authenticator_maps_list was used vs gateway_authenticator_maps

v3.3.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- The creation order for the workflows is 'workflow -> workflow nodes'. The deletion order is the same one, but in reverse.
- added auto_migrate_users_to option to the gateway authenticator role.
- added dependencies to our galaxy.yml, the lowest version has been set to collections compatible with AAP 2.5, which this collection already requires, This should not be a breaking or major change for anyone, just codifies our dependencies, now that a bug in console.redhat.com has been fixed.
- added scm_branch option to the eda_projects role, this requires ansible.eda >2.8.0, and fixes

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- In order to comply with stricter linting rules and to make the collection more explicit, controller roles were chagned to be explicit with ansible.controller. awx.awx was not compatible and this just codifies the change. Please transition to using the certified ansible.controller collection to continue using this collection.

v3.2.0
======

Major Changes
-------------

- Dispatch no longer calls the controller_organizations role by default, as the gateway_organizations role should be sufficient.
- Restucture the gateway_organizations role so that only one role needs to be called to create and configure the organization. Adds the logic which existed from the controller_organizations role previously.

Bugfixes
--------

- Correct README.md to indicate destroy_current_nodes is bool
- Fixed the object creation order for the gateway staf.
- Update loop label to only show name of credential type instead of entire json object
- Update loop label to only show name of job template instead of entire json object
- Update loop label to only show name of workflow job template instead of entire json object
- added missing references to controller_roles in dispatcher defaults
- added missing references to eda_credential_types and eda_event_streams in dispatcher defaults

v3.1.0
======

Major Changes
-------------

- renamed some more vars that got missed in the new naming convention.

Bugfixes
--------

- updated gateway services async and no log vars to correct naming convention.

v2.5.1
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Adds request_timeout to controller_export_diff module, and roles
- licence role now uses a boolean of controller_license.use_looup to determine whether to lookup subscriptions. A lookup is only needed to refresh the available pools, or if it has never been done. See Role Readme for details.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed issue with licence role not operating properly, when a controller never had credentials provided for subscription lookup. See Role Readme for proper usuage.
- Fixed issue with organization role not acceppting default environments option correctly.

v2.5.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible.cfg removed from root and galaxy.yml added to enable install from source

Bugfixes
--------

- Added more attributes to be expanded and used by the comparison
- Fixed lintering issues

v2.4.1

- added the possibility to export schedules through the filetree_create role
- filetree_create now allows to export objects for the specified organization
- remove depencency of CONTROLER_USERNAME variable for object_diff role by calling the API with api/me instead of calling the api/users and filtering by username

Bugfixes
--------

- Changes default value for `*_enforce_defaults` to false instead of the truthy value (due to the quotes), 'false'.
- Fix addition of `state: present` when `with_present: true`
- Temporarily fixed an error when installing docker-compose using pip (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76708329/docker-compose-no-longer-building-image-attributeerror-cython-sources for more information)
- When exporting job templates it was failing when missing some input information.
- When exporting schedules, the diff_mode was not treated correctly
- When importing the exported notification templates, the types of some values are not as expected.
- When importing the exported settings, fields like `AUTOMATION_ANALYTICS_LAST_GATHER: 2023-07-17T13:22:06.445818Z` caused problems with the multiple `:`.
- fix 'credentials' role ignoring 'update_secrets false' and forcing to default 'true'
- fixed an the users and teams field on the roles role to be correct and not singular.

v2.4.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Added Roles bulk_host_create, bulk_job_launch.
- Added new_name option to the roles applications, credential_types, execution_environments, inventories, projects, users.
- Added new_username option to user role.
- Added option to multiple roles to enforce defaults. This is described in each of the roles readmes and will slowly be rolled out to all applicable roles. This option enforces module/api defaults in order to prevent config drift. This makes it so if an option is NOT specified in a configuration it enforces the default value. It is not enabled by default.
- Added scm_branch option to inventory_sources role.
- Corrected various readmes.
- Credentials role credential type set to mandatory. This would fail in the past if it was not set, this just codifies it.
- If someone wants to have the old behavior, or only update projects with dispatch, the dispatch variable controller_configuration_dispatcher_roles can be overwritten and customized.
- Instances role - changed default of node_type and node_state to omit, as generally these cannot be changed on existing instances unless deploying new instances.
- Inventory role - added input_inventories option for constructed inventories.
- Removed project_update from dispatch. This is because with bringing update_project option in line with the module options, it was running twice both in project and project update. Since both roles use the same variable controller_projects.
- Set the default behavior of project_update to run the update as true, unless the user explicitly sets the variable update_project to overide the default behavior. This is because if the user is specifically calling project_update it should by default update the project.
- Updated workflow job template options to use non depreciated names for options. This should not affect any operations.
- added alias's for applicable roles to use the variables set by the awx cli export.
- added get_stats.yml playbook in the playbook folder to get some basic info on a Tower/Controller instance
- added option for using the export form of default execution environment.
- added option to roles role to support upcoming change to allow lists of teams and users to be used in the module.
- added options to license role to allow use of subcription lookup or pool_id.

--------

- Fixed defaults for values that are lists.
- Fixed filetree read to error when organization not defined.
- Fixed rrule in schedules to not be mandatory.

- avoid to create orgs during drop_diff
- fixed an extra blank line in schedules readme that was breaking the table
- removed references to redhat_cop as a collection namespace in the readme files.

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- updated object_diff role to use the infra namespace, that means to use the role it requires the infra version of the collection. Previous version required the redhat_cop
